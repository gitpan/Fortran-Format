Revision history for Perl extension Fortran::Format

0.90  Fri Sep 16 2005
        - Added reading support! (some bugs may be lurking there)
        - INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: matrices will be transposed on writing;
          non-rectangular nested arrays result in undefined behavior.
        - Fixed bug where 2(I8),I2 would reuse only the 2(I8) on subsequent
          lines instead of reusing the whole format string.

0.54  Fri Sep 16 2005
        - Fixed bug where 2(I8),I2 would be interpreted as 2(I8),2I2.

0.53  Mon May 24 2004
        - Changed t/write.t so that it ignores floating number tests unless
          $ENV{TEST_FLOAT} is set.

0.52  Fri Apr 23 2004
        - Fixed use of scale factor for F editing.
        - Fixed blank output for Iw.0 output of zero values.
        - Allow explicit use of zero scale factor.

0.51  Fri Apr 23 2004
        - Fixed bug where the complete format would be reused in 
        subsequent lines, instead of using only the last list, as
        dictated by the standard.
        - Fixed a related bug where there was an infinite loop when there
        were no edit descriptors to consume all the data.
        - Changed exception handling to croak and return a more meaningful 
        error message when there's a parsing error.
        - Now $format->write accepts array references and flattens them
        automatically.

0.50  Thu Apr 22 2004
