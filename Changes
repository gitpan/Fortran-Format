Revision history for Perl extension Fortran::Format

0.52  Mon May 24 2004
        - Fixed silly bug that precluded reusing formats because it forgot
          to clean the output buffer.

0.51  Fri Apr 23 2004
        - Fixed bug where the complete format would be reused in 
        subsequent lines, instead of using only the last list, as
        dictated by the standard.
        - Fixed a related bug where there was an infinite loop when there
        were no edit descriptors to consume all the data.
        - Changed exception handling to croak and return a more meaningful 
        error message when there's a parsing error.
        - Now $format->write accepts array references and flattens them
        automatically.
