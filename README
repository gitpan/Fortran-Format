Fortran::Format version 0.54
============================

This is a Perl implementation of the Fortran 77 formatted output facility
(input will be available in a future version). One possible use is for
producing input files for old Fortran programs, making sure that their
column-oriented records are rigorously correct. Fortran formats may also have
some advantages over printf in some cases: it is very easy to output an array,
reusing the format as needed; and the syntax for repeated columns is more
concise. Unlike printf, for good or ill, Fortran-formatted fields B<never>
exceed their desired width. For example, compare

    printf "%3d", 12345;                            # prints "12345"
    print Fortran::Format->new("I3")->write(12345); # prints "***"

This implementation was written in pure Perl, with portability and correctness
in mind. It implements the full ANSI standard for Fortran 77 Formats (or at
least it should). It was not written with speed in mind, so if you need to
process millions of records it may not be what you need.
